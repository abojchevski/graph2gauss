Tensorflow implementation of the method proposed in the paper:
"[Deep Gaussian Embedding of Graphs: Unsupervised Inductive Learning via Ranking](https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1ZdKJ-0W)", Aleksandar Bojchevski and Stephan Günnemann, ICLR 2018.

## Installation
```bash
python setup.py install
```

## Requirements
* tensorflow (>=1.4)
* sklearn (only for evaluation)

## Demo
See the notebook example.ipynb for a simple demo.

## Graphs without attributes
If you graph has no attribute information you can run the one-hot version of Graph2Gauss (G2G_oh) by setting X=I, where I is the identity matrix. Additionally, setting X=A+I, where A is the adjacency matrix often yields even better perfomance.
